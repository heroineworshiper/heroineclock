Programming HeroineClock 1:

All connections are made with the fat part of the connector facing towards the
circuit board.
Attach 5 pin programming cable from programmer to HeroineClock.
Connect 12V power supply to programmer.
Disconnect MCLR jumper on programmer.
make and run programmer clock2.hex


Calibrating HeroineClock thermometer:

Use images/key.xcf.bz2 to find test points.
Connect 1k resistor to thermometer connector.
Adjust gain until temperature says 212.
Connect 27.28k resistor to thermometer connector.
Adjust Vlow until temperature says 32.
